# Real-Time-Fuel-Price-Monitoring-Market-Insights-Dashboard
Small-to-medium transport companies, logistics providers, and retailers in fuel-dependent sectors often struggle to track fluctuating fuel prices (diesel, petrol, etc.) and make operational decisions based on trends. This project builds a live dashboard that monitors fuel prices by region/city, detects patterns, and triggers alerts on spikes.
