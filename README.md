# Real-Time-Fuel-Price-Monitoring-Market-Insights-Dashboard
Small-to-medium transport companies, logistics providers, and retailers in fuel-dependent sectors often struggle to track fluctuating fuel prices (diesel, petrol, etc.) and make operational decisions based on trends. This project builds a live dashboard that monitors fuel prices by region/city, detects patterns, and triggers alerts on spikes.

To run the codes:

1. run the file fuel_fetch_data.py to create the fuel_data.db and update in real time
2. run streamlit run fuel_dashbaord.py to open the dashboard
